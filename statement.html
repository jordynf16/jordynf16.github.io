  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <h1>Jordyn Fernandez</h1>
  <p>I use photography to capture things in the world that I am passionate about. I want the viewer to get to know me by looking at how I view the world. By the viewer looking at things through my eyes, it will allow them to make a connection with me and possibly the photo itself. The subjects in my photos represent the expression of my ideas, interpretations and interests. I mainly like to capture what catches my eye. I photograph things such as landscapes, portraits, concerts, and still objects. </p>
  <p>My images are of places I have been to, things I have experienced, and things that I have an interest in or connection with. I capture landscapes and places I have been to because I want to capture the beauty and make a memory of my time in that specific place. I capture things I have experienced because I want people to understand me and know my interests. I also capture things I have a connection with because that is how I plan to make a connection with the viewers. I search for things that are aesthetically pleasing to me that fit my style. The aesthetics that I look for include color, shape, texture, and light. Then when it comes to editing my images and capturing them, my techniques are very simple. So when editing, I add warm tones to be a part of my aesthetics for my work.</p>
