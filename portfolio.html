      <h3>"Do You Follow Me?", Video, 1:12, 2018</h3>
      <p>My concept for this video was about social media and social media influencers and how much we depend and are influenced by social media. When we are walking and looking at our phones, we aren't really paying attention to stuff around us either, so things around us seem to be going by fast. We are walking and too busy paying attention to our social media accounts trying to catch up on the latest trends, new drama, and even reading about news headlines. We depend on social media for everything and social media icons as well. </p>

    <h3>"Lets Get Spooky", Sound, 2018</h3>
    <p>With Halloween being my favorite holiday, I wanted to make a sound piece that gave an eerie vibe while listening to it.</p>

    <h3>"Myspace", Interactive Net Art, 2018</h3>
    <p>Myspace was a major thing for me back in the early 2000s. I would go on Myspace almost every day after school and spend so much time on there talking to friends, listening to music, and making sure my profile looked as cool as it could get.I wanted to create that sense of nostalgia and make it look like a myspace page that either I would create or a "typical" myspace page back then.</p>

    <h3>"Space Pixels", Interactive Net Art, 2018</h3>
    <p>My inspiration for this project was old video games, such as classic Nintendo video games. I chose to make it with all pixel images to give it that 8 bit/video game vibe.
